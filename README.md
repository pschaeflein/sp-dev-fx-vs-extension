# Visual Studio extension for SharePoint Framework projects
The SharePoint Framework introduces a new set of tools for client-side web development that may be unfamiliar for many enterprise developers and which may not fit well with existing ALM processes, especially those tightly integrated with Team Foundation Server and IDE extensions. This repository contains the source code and releases of a Visual Studio extension for SharePoint Framework that integrates the traditional solution, build, debug and project management tools of Visual Studio with open-source tools like Node.js, Gulp and Yeoman generators. Creating new Framework projects is now as easy as selecting File > New > Project, just like any standard MVC, Web API or ASP.NET application.

The Visual Studio Extension for SharePoint Framework wraps the command-line UI of the Microsoft Yeoman Generator (yo @microsoft/sharepoint) into a familiar Windows Forms experience, executes the generator project scaffolding behind the scenes and creates a Visual Studio project that includes all the necessary files for a complete web part project. Also included is a web part item template for adding new web parts to an existing Framework project. Developers can launch the Workbench local sandbox environment to test their web parts by pressing F5 or by binding to the Gulp Serve event in the Task Runner Explorer. For developers who wish to dive deeper and learn more about the new web development toolchain used by the Framework, the Advanced mode provides full access to the Yeoman generator command parameters and an optional cmd.exe window to view the generator tasks in real time.
